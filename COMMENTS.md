## Project setup
- Run npm start to start project
- RUN npm test to start unit test

## Issues found

  - Body text color of cards specify "rgba(116,127,138)" which is not compliant with accessibility standards I have chosen #263648 (accessibility compliant) which is the closest to the one specified.
  - Not really happy with mobile and tablet designs,stretched bodies and horizontal scrollbars not really favourable on mobile, its more prefered to have the cards stacked above each other or if really needs be add the cards to gallery style flip. I have added images in the public folder of how i would have handled mobile cards for media 768 & 375.
  - overall the brief lacked a bit of details but also provided myself the room to use my own expereince and knowledge. In a real life situation it would need to be specked bit more detailed.
  - The logic I found bit confusing reading and felt could perhaps be worded bit better.



## Final Thoughts

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the assesment as it allowed me to work within react enviroment and also work with unit tests which i dont often do.
